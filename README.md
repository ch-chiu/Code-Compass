# Knowledge-based System for Software Engineering

## Establish Knowledge-based System
- build connetions among domain informations, like code structure, history and PR
- provide services for explorations during software development

## Functions
- search C/C++ components (struct/function/class) by keywords
- present structural information, like associations among code blocks   
- present developer information of lines of code
- present PR information of lines of code

## Aspects
- UI with high-level interactivity and density of information
- scalable backend for associated information, considering code structure, history and PR
- connections between lines of code and components (struct/function/class) via code graph
- connections between lines of code and developers via analyzing commit history
- connections between lines of code and PR info via bugzilla(vmware) or github(open source)
